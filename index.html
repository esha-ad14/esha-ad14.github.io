        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Iâ€™m a software engineer with a foundation in computer science and electrical engineering. I have a bachelors in Computer Engineering and Economics from Texas A&M University, which has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of theoretical and practical aspects of technology. Over the years, I've gained skills in building robust, scalable web applications, and implementing best security practices. I enjoy learning about latest tech trends and concepts. I like to write about what I learn and share it on my blog.         </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I work at Wipro on the cybersecurity team. I implement Microsoft solutions such as Entra ID, Defender for Cloud, Intune and more for Fortune 500 companies. I also build out Azure Function templates in C# and Python for architects to utilize for various clients. 
        </p>
